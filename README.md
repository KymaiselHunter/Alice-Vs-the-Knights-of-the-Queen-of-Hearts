## Project Rundown
Our inspiration came from a game called celeste as we made a themed 2d game. In this game you play as, Alice, from Alice in the Wonderland. Her job is to defeat the giant cheshire cat at the end. Along the way you face foot soldiers that work for this cat. You have three lives and are given the ability to run, jump, attack, and slide. We built our game in Java and used sprites we found online for our background and characters. Challenges we ran into included, trying to make the background move infinitely and smoothly, the hit boxes for the characters, and making a static fight screen where the background doesnâ€™t move. We are proud of our whole game as none of us have ever made anything like this. What we learned is that coding is a very trial and error process and also that you should crop your sprites all the way to the edge of the character.

# What's next for Alice Vs the Knights of the Queen of Hearts
The final boss was meant to shoot projectiles at the player, which we did not have time to implement.
